# Grandma's birthday app

The Parker clan was supposed to get together in Wisconsin this weekend to celebrate Grandma's 90th birthday together. then covid happened. Since we couldn't celebrate in person, my cousin and I got everyone together to contribute audio clips and pictures, so my cousin could put together a birthday video montage celebrating the life of our grandma. 

My small contribution to the cause was to build a simple app that does one thing: open the video link to Grandma's video, full screen, landscape mode. Now all Grandma needs to do to watch the video on her tablet is 1) open the (VERY COLORFUL) birthday app icon, 2) wait for the video to load, 3) press the play icon in the center of the screen. Easy peasy!
